# The Four Fisherman

## Domain of Interest
### 1. Why are you interested in this field/domain?
We were interested in this domain because the fishing industry and seafood is a large part of Seattle's economy.

### 2. What other data driven projects have you found related to this domain?

  - [GIS Map of Fishing Piers in Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Seattle-Parks-and-Recreation-GIS-Map-Layer-Shapefi/rnss-rcmd)

  - [Salmon Habitat Status and Trend Monitoring Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/salmon-habitat-status-and-trend-monitoring-program-data)

  - [Fisheries Economic Explorer - FISHEYE](https://dataexplorer.northwestscience.fisheries.noaa.gov/fisheye/)

### 3. What data driven questions do you hope to answer about about the domain?

  - How large is the fishing industry, economically, in Washington State? How was it been affected by the coronavirus?
  
  - How do weather patterns and migration patterns affect the profits of the industry? Do they cause any major fluctuations?
  
  - How has overfishing affected the biodiversity and quality of caught fish?
  
  - How has pollution affected the number of food borne illnesses contracted in Seattle?


## Finding Data
### Dataset 1: King County Ambient Stream Monitoring Program 2007
  1. We found this data online from [King County](https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/services/environment/watersheds/streams-data/StreamTrendSummary2007.ashx?la=en)

  2. The data was collected by the King County Watersheds and Rivers Data Collection team. The data shows trends in water quality from 1971-2007 in King County rivers and         streams, measuring parameters such as ammonia concentration, pH level, disolved oxygen (DO) content, water temperature, etc.

 3. There are 64 observations (rows) in the dataset.

 4. There are 16 features (columns) in the dataset.

 5. The data in this dataset can partially answer our last question. While it doesn't include information on food borne illnesses contracted in Seattle, it does include data on     water quality in areas where people would fish. We could use this as a starting point to further answer the question.

### Dataset 2: Summary Report of the 2018 COmmerical Fishery for Razor Clams
  1. We found this data online from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and we are specifically looking at [Table 5](https://wdfw.wa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/02115/wdfw02115.pdf).
    
  2. This data was collected by Zach Forster who is a researcher for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. This data is about the daily landings, effort, and take home limits of the 2018 commercial razor clam season.
  
  3. This dataset has 96 observations.
  
  4. This dataset has 8 features.
  
  5. This data does not help answer any of the above questions.
  

### Dataset 3: Washington Review of Commercial Fisheries 2014-2015 Sardine and Mackerel and 2014 Anchovy
  1. We found this data online from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and we are specifically looking at [Table 3](https://wdfw.wa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/01883/wdfw01883.pdf)

  2. This data was collected by Lorna Wargo and Kristen Hinton who are both Fisheries Biologists and researchers for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. This data was collected to look at biomass, harvest guidelines, and landings of sardine from 2000 through 2014-2015.
  
  3. This dataset has 16 observations.
  
  4. This dataset has 6 features.
  
  5. This data could be used to look at overfishing and to see if it occurs whithin certain species or during which years.
