use was measured as a percent of women aged 15-49. The level of sexual education
taught in public high schools is determined at the state level. We found that

teach sex-ed and it must be medically accurate, (2) R, where schools are required
to teach sex-ed, but the curriculum is not regulated, and (3) NR, where schools
are not at all obligated by the state government to teach any form of sexual
education. In this project we seek to determine possible correlations between the
